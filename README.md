## Overview

CC (Cyberchess) is a modern chess platform designed to provide an advanced chess-playing experience. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive chess solution with features including game play, analysis, and training capabilities.

### Vision

To create an accessible, feature-rich chess platform that serves players of all skill levels while maintaining high standards of code quality and user experience.

## Features

### Planned Features
- **Chess Engine**: Implementation of standard chess rules and move validation
- **Game Modes**: 
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Computer
  - Online Multiplayer
- **Game Analysis**: Post-game analysis with move suggestions and evaluations
- **Training Mode**: Chess puzzles and tactical exercises
- **Opening Book**: Database of common chess openings
- **Game History**: Save and replay previous games
- **Multiple Board Themes**: Customizable board and piece designs
- **Time Controls**: Support for various time formats (Blitz, Rapid, Classical)
- **Rating System**: ELO-based player rating system

*Note: Project structure will be updated as development progresses.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites will be documented as the project develops. Expected requirements may include:
- A modern web browser (for web-based version)
- Node.js and npm (if using JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Python 3.x (if using Python)
- Or other runtime environments based on final technology stack

### Installation

Installation instructions will be provided once the project has deployable components.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GizzZmo/CC.git
cd CC

# Further installation steps to be documented
```

### Configuration

Configuration guidelines will be added as the project develops configuration requirements.

## Usage

Usage documentation will be provided as features are implemented.

## Development

### Building from Source

Build instructions will be documented once the build system is established.

### Running Tests

Testing procedures will be documented once the test suite is created.

### Code Style

Code style guidelines will be established based on the chosen programming language and framework:
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Write unit tests for all new features

## Contributing

Contributions to CC are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the project
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix
4. **Write Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests
5. **Commit Your Changes**: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
6. **Push to Branch**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your changes for review

### Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear commit messages
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions

## Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in users and features
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast move calculation and responsive UI
- **Testability**: Write code that is easy to test
- **Maintainability**: Keep code clean, documented, and well-structured

### Technology Stack
The technology stack will be determined and documented as development progresses.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Planned)
- [ ] Choose technology stack
- [ ] Implement basic chess board representation
- [ ] Implement move generation and validation
- [ ] Create basic UI for board display

### Phase 2: Core Features (Planned)
- [ ] Implement full chess rules (castling, en passant, promotion)
- [ ] Add Player vs Player mode
- [ ] Implement game state management (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- [ ] Add move history and notation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- [ ] Integrate chess engine for AI opponent
- [ ] Add game analysis features
- [ ] Implement online multiplayer
- [ ] Add user accounts and rating system

### Phase 4: Polish (Planned)
